Error upon script execution: "syntax error: unexpected end of file"
==> If you have checked out the files on Windows, text file endings will be automatically converted during checkout to Windows format (\r\n).
==> If you want to execute the scripts using e.g. the Ubuntu on Windows environment under Windows 10, you need  to convert the line endings to Linux format (\n). 
    Check, if you are in the main folder of the MCCCS system (e.g. check the output of the 'pwd' command) and then use the command 
	find . -type f | grep .sh$ | xargs dos2unix
    to convert script line endings to the proper format for this environment.
