# Welcome to MCCCS documentation

For an overview and download of the MCCCS scripts please visit the project [hompage](http://openimageanalysisgroup.github.io/MCCCS/).

## Getting started

The provided mcccs.zip file includes the utility commands for image processing and file conversion, which are
included into the mcccs.jar. Preferred machine learning libraries can be individually selected by the user (here, for the application examples, the WEKA library is used). Also example scripts and datasets are included to show the systems main capabilities, within different application examples. Usually, several commands are summarized in a script file which represents a so called pipeline. All commands, included in the mcccs.jar, can be run by using a command-line interface (terminal or shell).
